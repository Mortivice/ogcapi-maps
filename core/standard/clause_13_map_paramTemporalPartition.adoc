[[rc_datetime]]
== Requirement Class "Maps temporal partitioning"

=== Overview

[[maps-datetime-overview]]

include::requirements/requirements_class_datetime.adoc[]

This conformance class defines the way date and time can be used as a parameter to filter the content in the map resource. This conformance class is importing most of the functionality from OGC API - Commons.

=== Describing the temporal extent

Depending on the type of resource, the way the temporal extent and the resolution of the datetime values available for the client to request are described may be different:

* For Geodata maps, the collection description should specify the temporal extent of the resources. Maps can be requested inside this extent. If the extent is specified in a way that instant values are provided (e.g. by listing them or by including a resolution) then it be possible to request maps for these instants.
* For Dataset maps, the landingPage could specify the temporal extent of the dataset. Maps can be requested inside this extent.

=== `datetime` query parameter request and response

This section is based on the OGC API common datetime module that is entirely reproduced here.

include::api_modules/datetime/requirements_module_datetime.adoc[]

=== `subset=datetime` query parameter request and response

The behavior of the subset parameter is imported from the OGC API - Common subset module. The entire module is reproduced here.
However some consideration may not apply for datetime and the generic behavior is limited by predetermining the axis name of the generic datetime in an additional requirement, a permission and a recommendation at the end of this subsection.
