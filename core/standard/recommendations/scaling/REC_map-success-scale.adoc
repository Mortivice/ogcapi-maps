^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/scaling/map-success-scale*
^|A |The resolution of the content represented in the map SHOULD be consistent with the `width` and `height` of the viewport indicated and should consider the `cell-size` In case of vector data (e.g. KML or SVG) the geometries should be simplified to match the `cell-size` of the viewport (raster responses are simplified to match the `width` and `height`).
